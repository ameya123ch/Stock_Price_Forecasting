### Background: 
Stock price forecasting is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Predicting stock prices accurately is essential for investors, traders, and financial institutions to make informed decisions. Traditional statistical models are often not sufficient to capture the complex relationships between variables in stock prices. Therefore, it is necessary to use advanced techniques such as deep learning and machine learning to forecast stock prices.

### Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a stock price time series analysis and forecasting system using LSTM and Facebook Prophet to accurately predict future stock prices.

### Methodology: 
The proposed system will use both LSTM and Facebook Prophet to analyze and forecast stock prices. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly effective in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. Facebook Prophet is a time series forecasting model that uses additive regression models to capture seasonal and trend patterns in data.
The system will be trained on a historical dataset of stock prices, which will include features such as volume, open price, close price, and high and low prices. The system will employ several techniques to improve the accuracy of stock price forecasting, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
The system's performance will be evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization performance. The system's performance will also be compared to traditional statistical models to evaluate its effectiveness.

### Expected Outcomes: 
The system is expected to achieve high accuracy in stock price forecasting, which will help investors and financial institutions make informed decisions. The system will also be scalable, meaning it can handle large volumes of stock price data without compromising its accuracy.

### Conclusion: 
The proposed stock price time series analysis and forecasting system using LSTM and Facebook Prophet will help investors and financial institutions improve their stock price forecasting models and make more accurate investment decisions. It will be an essential tool for stockbrokers, financial advisors, and other professionals involved in stock market investments.
